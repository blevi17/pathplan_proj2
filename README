The purpose of this project is to get what is essentially a point robot through and obstacle space, trace back the optimal path and then somehow visualize that

I have a main code that resembles code that is designed to resemble the instructions in the report, and I have a function code for things that I don't want to take up sapce in the main code.

The first version of this readme is not going to have much going on as the first version of my code might work, but I can' confirm without any visualization.
The visualization might be different file as it the main code that finds the optimal path takes long enough to run.
Also, it is missing the traceback function.

What my code can do is reach the goal node while recording the smallest cost.  It is not a fast fucntion, but hopefully when I graph it, it will work.
